## Project Importance
For my senior year of college at The Ohio State University, we were assigned a capstone group tasked with completing a year-long project. There were a variety of topics we could possibly be assigned; from creating a workbench meant for Starlab to conducting research for both the Navy and Airforce to creating a cost-effective high-altitude balloon (HAB) using off-the-shelf components. Can you guess which one I was assigned?

For more context on the reason behind this project, the first aerospace engineering course (AERO 2200: Introduction to Aerospace Engineering) that each new, bright-eyed sophmore in the major takes will conduct a high-altitude balloon lab at one point. This lab involves a launch of a high-altitude balloon by the professor and other academic faculty in order to collect atmospheric data such as ambient temperature and pressure in order to be analyzed by the students. The purpose for this lab is to teach the students the standard atmosphere (specifically, how air pressure, temperature, and density changes with altitude).

In prior years, including my sophmore year, there were a multitude of issues with the commerical weather balloons that can be bought off the internet (i.e., BLANK and BLANK). The issues ranging from the balloons themself pre-maturely bursting before it could reach the target altitude or the payload electronics being lost mid-flight. This was a concern to the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) Department since each year they would have to spend upwards of $1000+ for a new weather balloon for each year. This is where our project's importance came in since the goal was to create a new weather balloon payload using off-the-shelf components that was cost-effective (sub $600 for the payload) that could reliably reach a target altitude of 100,000 ft and be recovered for future use. If it couldn't be recovered, the low cost for each payload was important so the department wouldn't need to spend as much money for each launch.

### Launch Equipment List

|Equipment|Description|Price|Amount|Total Cost|
| ------ | ------------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| [Helium](https://www.ballooniacs.com/medium-110-cu-ft-helium-tank-rental/) | Obviously need helium for our balloon. Tank rentals can vary, but if you are in the Columbus, OH area I highly recommend BALLOONIACS. They are very nice and were able to get us a tank of helium on very short notice. Just make sure you double check how much helium you will need before launch! | ~$300.00 | 1 | ~$300.00 |
| [Balloon(s)](https://www.scientificsales.com/8244-Weather-Balloon-1200-Grams-Natural-p/8244.htm) | Obviously need a balloon so our project lifts of the ground. Just double check the size balloon you need to reach your target altitude. We went with a 1200 gram balloon in order to reach 100,000 ft | $110.00 | 1 | $110.00 |
| [Pressure Regulator](https://www.amazon.com/Harris-3000606-25GX-Regulator-500-580/dp/B005V0RAYI/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1WMKSOFAIOLM7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g5ClGlclQesMPfjxYGbqaYpNrYic_xLnGNqCXls0OfP0UusrJHA5ri58M3NcdQY8bnYWUKq-v5N51fqfM5WPPQQthYTr00TB5O_UPBnfVwfbqZttlkZwAvdbE9LHVmqOngNy4toz2AiYas4lRryTuEbG7mQUYeinYIKttFnmeVhtmOAwY6KYAXAsCozlKUe6vw9HAbG4IW3s3zi6h6fMC4qseWjw6DQnHlNsiMfqX-H0O8_HUU4hadGMMjgt7Waikhk7-leHg3L150lOGXrSYUWN3L0rXKQdX8DtDkUJB-w.G5_aNA7szjHYuLN207V6bJwu009ZIQRhzUIxc0aP9ws&dib_tag=se&keywords=Harris+25-100+Compressed+Gas+Pressure+Regulator&qid=1712353964&sprefix=harris+25-100+compressed+gas+pressure+regulator%2Caps%2C90&sr=8-2) | A pressure regulator helps fill the balloon safely. This is similar to the one we used, I just recommend getting one with a flared end in order to screw directly into the helium bottle. Obviously this can be replace with a similar device/method that is cheaper or more accessible to you! I was just fortunate enough to borrow one from our engineering department | $141.07 | 1 | $141.07 |
| [Quick Disconnect Hose](https://www.amazon.com/Hromee-Compressor-Fittings-Industrial-Coupler/dp/B08V17V6WJ/ref=sr_1_8?crid=BMX1VC4WT23Z&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.NgZBocZ_1LEJEtMgpTqpvsc3ocLB-SoYeiwW7bv7csS1j1v0vJbWUoak9v0-knLA7ZXfbiFETH94pleUP7hnrMjqsjbCy2HB21Mb3x-0cvPu6orkxUqL8jHwjTmYGAo0HDAonMcUYolvQwpyKaA1PaB7mnGsDdbpTnWQLAL4BY-ScWF0WeOcPC3oX97GrHyLLHzU2AGy5ITuLRqWUIdaxwT67HdSgz255NAk70J8MxE5MBa4j80F5FfZjapiz4pcfyflje-EC5-VvQbB9ExrSKPmF9ah3qmMEh3a7mm0t6I.P-d4v0BuHc05wo2yFXIuIZcz6ss8Qt2CdoJhKjgdLoY&dib_tag=se&keywords=air+compressor+hose&qid=1712354156&sprefix=air+compressor+hose%2Caps%2C88&sr=8-8) | Air compressor hose for connecting the helium bottle to our ball-valve nozzle that is used to fill the balloon (pictured below). Doesn't have to be this exact same one, I just suggest something similar to this one. | $19.99 | 1 | $19.99 |
| [Fish Scale](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JWGHC48?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) | You can use this to determine how much helium is in your balloon. This gives the buoyancy force and then you can figure out the volume of helium inside the balloon if you assume it's spherical. I suggest making sure the fish scale can read the intended buoyancy force. | $19.99 | 1 | $19.99 |
| [Teflon Tape](https://www.menards.com/main/plumbing/plumbing-installation-repair/pipe-sealants-caulk-putty/blue-monster-teflon-pipe-thread-sealant-tape/70886/p-1444440440571-c-8531.htm?exp=false) | For sealing the threads of the pressure regulator when screwing it into the helium bottle | $4.31 | 1 | $4.31 |
| [Large Zip Ties](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Tough-14-5-inch-75lb-Yellow-Cable-Ties-50-Count/595201774?from=/search) | For sealing the balloon and attaching the payload/parachute to the balloon. I recommend wrapping the part of the zip tie that will rub up against the balloon with a bit of electrical tape in order to prevent it from cutting the latex | $7.48 | 1 | $7.48 |
| [Wrenches](https://www.menards.com/main/tools/hand-tools/pliers-plier-sets/masterforce-reg-groove-joint-pliers/84-550/p-1444425505984-c-9156.htm) | For screwing the pressure regulator into the helium bottle. Just make sure whichever ones you use will fit the nut on the pressure regulator you're using | $9.78 | 1 | $19.78 |
| [Tarp](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Tough-Weather-Resistant-Light-Duty-6-x-8-Polyethylene-Tarp/603949195?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&wl13=2098&adid=22222222277603949195_117755028669_12420145346&wmlspartner=wmtlabs&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=501107745824&wl4=pla-306310554666&wl5=9014961&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=local&wl12=603949195&wl13=2098&veh=sem_LIA&gclsrc=aw.ds&&adid=22222222237603949195_117755028669_12420145346&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=501107745824&wl4=pla-306310554666&wl5=9014961&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=local&wl12=603949195&veh=sem&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwwr6wBhBcEiwAfMEQswRwFDO85AEUwWshLEQ89RyRzZsJuGzKVzQDvG8kP0XF5DSPqd6hUhoCv3gQAvD_BwE) | For setting up the balloon. Un-rolling the balloon in the grass can cause issues with the latex so I highly recommend getting a big tarp to set everything up | $4.66 | 1 | $4.66 |
| [Ball-Valve Filling Apparatus](https://www.highaltitudescience.com/products/3-cm-max-safe-inflator) | Mentioned previously, this was inserted into the neck of the balloon in order to fill it. A picture of it is included directly below. I HIGHLY reccommend you making your own. A hundred dollars for this one seems a bit extreme in my opinion and you could definitely make one for cheaper. | $99.99 | 1 | $99.99 |

| [Parachute](https://the-rocketman.com/recovery-html/) | Used for slowing down the payload upon the descent. I suggest weighing your payload and adding on the weight of the balloon youre using then going to the rocketman website to see what parachute size is suitable. I went with a 3ft parachute but I think we should have went up to either a 4ft or a 5ft parachute to slow it down even quicker. | $45.50 | 1 | $45.50 |

## Payload Construction

## Payload Arduino Code

So this was my first big project that utilized Arduino and the coding language so I apologize upfront if my code looks terrible. I know it's not as optimized as it could be, but I made sure to comment it as best as possible so everyone can follow it.

## Useful Online Tools

The first useful online tool that I used for this project was this [Balloon Perfomance Calculator](https://www.highaltitudescience.com/pages/balloon-performance-calculator) created by High Altitude Science. I liked using this for seeing how much helium I needed for my balloon-payload setup and ensuring that it would reach my target altitude.

The second useful online tool I used for this project was this [Flight Path Predictor](https://predict.sondehub.org/?launch_datetime=2024-04-09T08%3A00%3A00Z&launch_latitude=39.795&launch_longitude=276.93600000000004&launch_altitude=275&ascent_rate=5.22&profile=standard_profile&prediction_type=single&burst_altitude=30000&descent_rate=6) created by Jon Sowman, Adam Grieg, and Daniel Richman of Cambridge University. I found this tool later into this project and honestly it was really cool to use and predict where we would expect our balloon to drift to depending on the day/time/weather/altitude. [PUT IN BLURB ABOUT HOW THIS WAS COMPARED TO OUR ACTUAL FLIGHT TEST].
